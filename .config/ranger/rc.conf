# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create the file
# ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf and add your custom commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.
# ===================================================================

# ===================================================================
# == Options
# ===================================================================

# How many columns are there, and what are their relative widths?
set column_ratios 2,4

# Ask for a confirmation when running the "delete" command?
# Valid values are "always", "never", "multiple" (default)
# With "multiple", ranger will ask only if you delete multiple files at once.
set confirm_on_delete always

# Draw borders around columns?
set draw_borders separators

# Show hostname in titlebar?
set hostname_in_titlebar false
